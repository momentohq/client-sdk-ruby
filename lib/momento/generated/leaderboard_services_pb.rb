      # Like a sorted set, but for leaderboards!

      # Elements in a leaderboard are keyed by an ID, which is an unsigned 64 bit integer.
      # Scores are single-precision floating point numbers.
      #
      # Each ID can have only 1 score.
      #
      # For batchy, multi-element apis, limits are 8192 elements per api call.
      #
      # Scores are IEEE 754 single-precision floating point numbers. This has a few
      # implications you should be aware of, but the one most likely to affect you is that
      # below -16777216 and above 16777216, not all integers are able to be represented.
