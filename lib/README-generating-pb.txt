Currently, the Ruby code generated by gRPC will not compile.
See https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-ruby/issues/12

If #12 is not fixed, here are the steps to regenerate the
pb classes.

1. Generate them as normal using grpc_tools_ruby_protoc.
2. Remove the leading `PB__` from the constants in ControlClient and CacheClient.
3. Remove the leading `_` from the ControlClient and CacheClient references in the Service classes.

Or...

```
perl -i -p -e 's{PB__}{}g' lib/*_pb.rb
perl -i -p -e 's{\b_}{}g' lib/*_services_pb.rb
```
